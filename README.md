This project focuses on building an AI-based Object Detection system that can automatically identify and locate multiple objects within an image or video frame. It uses deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Vision Transformers to perform real-time detection with high accuracy.

The system is trained on a labeled dataset containing various object categories and uses bounding boxes to highlight detected objects. Its goal is to support automation, surveillance, and image analysis tasks by providing fast and accurate detection results.

Key features include:

⚙️ Model: YOLO / Vision Transformer-based object detection

🧠 Function: Detects and classifies multiple objects in a single image

📦 Output: Bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores

🚀 Applications: Smart surveillance, autonomous systems, and visual inspection
